# PinkWorld
Pink World is a mobile application dedicated to raising awareness and supporting the fight against breast cancer by promoting self-examination and early detection of it that was born from an idea by Professor Gloria Diaz from ITM and that we wanted to implement for this course as a final project. This disease affects 1 in 8 women according to a Globocan study. In Colombia 35% of diagnosed women die and in developed countries 11%. The Application will help to guarantee a correct follow-up of processes that help to prevent the disease, since the user will be able to register their self-exams, follow-up exams, analysis documents and everything related to their process and treatment.
